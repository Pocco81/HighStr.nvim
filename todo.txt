Create a plugin that will provide users with a bunch of utilities for formating text in a better way than usual. Since there are already a bunch of plugins with various functionalities, the current goal is to translate and improve existing ones to Lua + create the functionalities that don't exist [yet]. These are the plugins:

1. Format text (align)	(No plugin)
2. Vim-pencil			(Plugin exists)
3. Highlight text		(No plugin)
4. vim-bookmarks		(Plugin exists)
5. vim-litecorrect		(Plugin exists)
6. vim-ditto			(Plugin exists)



Previewed commands for each mode:
	1)
		DMAlign [left/right]	- defualt = left
	2)
		DMPencil [soft/hard]	- default = soft
	3)
		DMHighlight [<1-9>]		- default = 0
	4)
		DMBookmark [toggle/create/delete/annotate/save/next/prev]	- default = toggle
	5)
		DMCorrection [start/stop/toggle]	- defualt = toggle
	6)
		DMRepetition [start/stop/toggle]	- defualt = toggle
